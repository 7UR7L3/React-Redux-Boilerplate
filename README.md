# Herein I shall play around with React and Redux and theoretically learn something useful.

### Collection of videos that I've used to get a bearing.
- [Traversy Media -- Useful standalone video that uses sublime.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCshQ290g38)
- [thenewboston -- Nice general overview (source of this fork)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBbSLZjvleMwldX8jGgXV6a)
- [Kurt Weiberth -- More in depth overview (haven't completed)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQDnxXqV213JJFtDaG0aE9vqvp6Wm7nBg)

----------

## TODO:
- learn why this has Sass and why I should learn that too.

----------

##### Old README summary:
```npm install; webpack; npm run start```

(I will keep this here, moved to the end, moreso just to keep terminology fresh)
